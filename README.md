# Mohammed E. – Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer

### 🚀 About Me  
I am a dedicated data scientist transitioning from a seasoned radar-engineering background into building impactful AI and machine-learning solutions. With experience in hardware systems and full-stack ML workflows, I bring a unique blend of domain knowledge, programming fluency, and analytical rigor. My core mission: **turn raw data into actionable intelligence**, whether for aviation-safety, space-industry prediction, or enterprise-scale analytics.

I thrive in ambiguity, love solving hard problems, and deliver end-to-end solutions — from data ingestion and feature engineering, through model development (Keras/TensorFlow), to production-ready deployment.  
My technical foundation is rooted in signal processing and embedded systems; my passion drives me into deep learning, unsupervised models, generative architectures and Big Data. I’m eager to collaborate on projects where data science meets real-world systems.

### 🎯 Featured Projects  
- **[Aircraft-Surface-Damage-Classification-and-Captioning](https://github.com/IBOSS24/Aircraft-Surface-Damage-Classification-and-Captioning)**  
  Developed a deep convolutional architecture that classifies damage types on aircraft surfaces and generates natural-language captions for maintenance crews. The project combined transfer learning (ResNet/VGG base) + custom decoder for caption generation, improving inspection efficiency in aerospace operations.

- **[SpaceX Falcon 9 — First-Stage Landing Prediction](https://github.com/IBOSS24/SpaceX_competitor_-)**  
  Built a predictive model to forecast successful first-stage landings of the Falcon 9 rocket. Features included telemetry data, flight-profile embeddings, and a binary classification pipeline (Keras/TensorFlow) achieving high precision in predicting landing outcomes under real-world conditions.

> Each project is publicly available on GitHub with thorough documentation, dataset overview, model architecture diagrams, and reproducible notebooks.
